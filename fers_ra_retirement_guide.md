> 🛠️ **Welcome!**  
> This guide is for federal employees facing medical challenges who are exploring **reasonable accommodations**, **disability retirement**, or **early retirement options** under FERS. Whether you're ADOS, a veteran, or any public servant navigating chronic health conditions, this guide is for you.

## Section 1: Understanding Reasonable Accommodations (RA)

**What is a Reasonable Accommodation?**  
A reasonable accommodation is any change or adjustment to a job or work environment that allows a qualified individual with a disability to perform essential job functions. This is a right under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which applies to federal employees.

**Common Accommodations Include:**
- Permanent or expanded telework
- Flexible work schedules
- Modified job duties
- Ergonomic equipment
- Reassignment to a vacant position

**Eligibility Criteria:**
- The employee must have a documented physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.
- The disability must interfere with the ability to perform essential job functions without accommodations.

**The Process:**
1. **Initiate the request** by contacting your supervisor or agency Disability Program Manager (DPM).
2. **Provide medical documentation** that supports your condition and how it limits your ability to perform duties.
3. **Participate in the interactive process** to identify effective accommodations.
4. **Receive a determination** from the agency and begin accommodations if approved.

**Tips:**
- Document all communications and submit requests in writing.
- Be specific about how your condition affects your duties.
- You do not need to disclose your exact diagnosis—just the functional limitations.

## Section 2: FERS Retirement Options

### 1. Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA)
- For employees aged **50 with 20 years** or **any age with 25 years** of service.
- Immediate pension with no early penalty.
- Includes FERS Annuity Supplement (mimics Social Security until age 62).

### 2. FERS Disability Retirement
- Available after **18 months** of FERS-covered service.
- Must be unable to perform duties due to a medical condition expected to last at least 1 year.
- Agency must be unable to accommodate or reassign you.
- You must apply for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) as part of the process.

**FERS Disability Pay Structure:**
- **Year 1:** 60% of High-3 average salary minus 100% of SSDI.
- **Years 2 until age 62:** 40% of High-3 average salary minus 60% of SSDI.
- **At age 62:** Converted to a regular FERS annuity.

## Section 3: Combining VA Disability with Federal Benefits

**Key Points:**
- You may receive both **VA disability** and **FERS annuity**.
- **VA pay is not taxed**, while FERS income is taxable.

**Example Conditions That Support RA or Disability:**
- Gastrointestinal disorders (IBS, GERD)
- Chronic migraines
- Cancer (e.g., colon carcinoma)
- PTSD or other psychological conditions

---

## Section 4: Planning and Documentation Tips

- Keep **records of flare-ups, missed work, and accommodations** attempted.
- Use **VA award letters** and **doctor notes** to support your RA or disability case.
- Track **all communications** with HR, supervisors, and the DPM.

## 💡 Interactive Retirement Benefit Calculator (Coming Soon)

We are developing a web-based calculator that will allow federal employees to estimate their retirement benefits under a variety of scenarios, including:

- Years of creditable FERS service
- Estimated "High-3" average salary
- VA disability rating and compensation level
- Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) balance and withdrawal strategy
- Eligibility for FERS Annuity Supplement
- Social Security projections at ages 62, 67, or 70

The calculator will allow users to:
- Compare FERS Disability vs. Early Retirement (VERA)
- Visualize income over time, including phased retirement or delayed Social Security
- Estimate net income after taxes, insurance, and SSDI offsets
- Simulate flexible work or part-time employment impacts

**Status:** In development. If you would like to contribute to the coding or receive updates, please contact the page maintainer or watch the GitHub repository once published.
